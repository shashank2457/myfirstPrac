Iejdsadskj hkhs kdha sak skja dhas khdkja sdhkja gistered a new domain (ssml.io) and I want to use it to host a static website using S3 and Cloudfront. For this website I want an SSL connection using a AWS Certificate Manager certificate.
To finish this setup you have to go through these steps:
Create an S3 bucket and upload your index.html file
Create a cloudfront distribution pointing to this S3 bucket
Setup Domain MX records using SES to receive the SSL certificate domain validation email
Request a new SSL certificate in region us-east-1 (!)
Assign the certificate to your Cloudfront distribution
I assume that you already have a (new) domain registered in Route 53 with no A or MX records setup.
